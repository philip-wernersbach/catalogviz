	<h1>What is this?</h1>

	<div>
		<p>
			This app visualizes the dependency trees for a course that you enter.

			That is, when you enter the full or partial name of a course and click "Search", the
			app will display that course, all of its corequisites and prerequisites, all of the
			corequisites and prerequisites for those courses, and so on and so forth.
		</p>
		<p>
			The app visualizes the dependency trees in the form of a directed graph, which can be
			manipulated using your mouse. You can click and drag the graph, use the mouse scroll
			wheel to zoom into the graph, and drag individual circles in the graph around.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>
			Classes are represented by circles, and the arrows that point from one circle to another
			represent dependencies.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span id="green">Green</span> arrows represent corequisites.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span id="blue">Blue</span> arrows represent prerequisites.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>
			The larger circles in the middle represent courses that are prerequisites or corequisites
			for a large number of other courses. The smaller circles in the outer portions of the graph are
			prerequisites or corequisites for either a few courses, or no courses at all.
