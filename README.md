CatalogViz
==========

This repository contains the open source parts of CatalogViz. CatalogViz is a middleware for
[Philip Wernersbach](http://github.com/philip-wernersbach)'s proprietary DataCompute database
engine. DataCompute makes aggregating, querying, and visualizing generic datasets easy, and
CatalogViz allows universities to import and export course data to/from the DataCompute engine,
allowing universities to utilize DataCompute's advanced features for their course datasets.

The Code
--------

This repository contains the open source parts of CatalogViz. Stub implementations of the
proprietary parts of CatalogViz are also provided so that the open source parts can be compiled.

The Visualization
-----------------

An example visualization is available online at [http://philip-wernersbach.github.io/catalogviz](http://philip-wernersbach.github.io/catalogviz).
The visualization allows the user to enter the name of a course and then it generates a graph showing
the dependencies for that course. The visualization is made from real course catalog data that is
pulled from a real CatalogViz setup.
