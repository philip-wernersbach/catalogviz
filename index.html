		<p>
			This website contains an example visualization for course dependencies.
			The visualization was created with the CatalogViz middleware on top of the DataCompute database engine.
			DataCompute makes aggregating, querying, and visualizing generic datasets easy, and CatalogViz allows universities 
			to import and export course data to/from the DataCompute engine, allowing universities to utilize DataCompute's
			advanced features for their course datasets.
